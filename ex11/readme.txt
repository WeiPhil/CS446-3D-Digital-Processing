- Comparing Lx = b and L2x = b

We see that for the non-squared laplacian the model behaves more like 
a minimal surface in the sense that it tries to minimalize the deformation energy.
The model streches very locally.

In the laplacian squared situation the whole model bends because it tries 
to resist more like thin plates by not streching but more by bending.

- Comparing Different Laplacian Weights

The uniform weights do not accurately really respect the original curvature 
once the bending is done.

- Comparing with Physical Deformation

The difference comes when we deform to the extreme, real materials would snap or break whereas 
here any deformations are accepted. Another difference is self-intresection, such things aren't possible
in the physical world.
