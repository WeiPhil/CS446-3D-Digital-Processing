- Comparing Lx = b and L2x = b

We see that for the non-squared laplacian the model behaves more like 
a minimal surface in the sense that it tries to minimalize the deformation energy.
The model streches very locally.

In the laplacian squared situation the whole model bends because it tries 
to resist more like thin plates by not streching but more by bending.

- Comparing Different Laplacian Weights

The uniform weights do not accurately really respect the original curvature 
once the bending is done.

- Comparing with Physical Deformation

None. // TODO?
